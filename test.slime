//Welcome to Slime Editor/Script
//Keep in mind this is a VERY basic language and should only be used for educational purposes, it is not intended for actual use. Just teaching/learning the basics.
//Here are some basic examples:



//Set Variables using the keyword VAR.
//Format:
// VAR name value


VAR name Elijah

VAR age 15


//Print using LOG

LOG Hello World!

//Print out variables Using the format: 
// %variable_name$
//for example:

LOG %name$

LOG %age$

//Do Math!
//Use the Push keyword to define what numbers you want to do math to
PUSH 3
PUSH 8

//Adding should be 11.
LOG Result of adding 3 and 8 should return 11...

//Use the Add keyword to do addition
ADD

//Finally take the result and print it out using the Pick keyword
PICK

//You can also Multiply, Divide, Subtract and Mod (Take the modulo)
PUSH 3

//11*3 should be 33
LOG 11*3 should be 33...

MULTIPLY

POP

//If you want to retrieve the answer from the math equation, but you also want to make it not use the last answer use the Pop keyword.

PUSH 4
PUSH age
ADD
